%description
This is a C version of Bob Jenkin's spooky hash. The only advantage
over Bob's original version is that it is in C, not C++ and comes
with some test and benchmark code.

This is a very competitive hash function, but is somewhat unportable
(64bit little endian only). It's more portable than some of the
contenders like CityHash.
